Assignment Overview:
In this assignment, students will create a learning plan to ensure they stay informed about the latest updates, trends, and advancements in the Ruby programming language and Ruby on Rails framework. They will identify relevant resources, set a schedule for learning, and outline their strategies for continuous improvement.

Instructions:

Step 1: Identify Learning Resources

Instruct students to research and identify reliable resources for staying informed about Ruby and Rails updates. These resources can include websites, blogs, newsletters, podcasts, YouTube channels, forums, and more.
Encourage them to choose a mix of resources that cater to different learning preferences (e.g., reading, listening, watching).
Step 2: Set Learning Goals

Ask students to define specific learning goals. What areas of Ruby and Rails do they want to stay updated on? This could include new features, best practices, performance enhancements, security updates, and more.
Step 3: Create a Learning Schedule

Guide students to create a weekly or monthly schedule dedicated to staying informed. They should allocate a specific amount of time for learning, ensuring it fits within their routine.
