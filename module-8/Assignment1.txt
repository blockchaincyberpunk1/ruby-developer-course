Building a RESTful API

Objective: To understand and practice creating RESTful APIs using Ruby on Rails.

Task:

In this assignment, students will extend their existing Task Management App by adding a RESTful API. They will implement API endpoints for tasks, secure the API with token-based authentication, and provide comprehensive API documentation.

Instructions:

Extend the Application:

Instruct students to extend their Task Management App by adding API functionality alongside the web interface.
API Endpoints:

Define the following RESTful API endpoints:
GET /api/tasks: Retrieve a list of tasks.
GET /api/tasks/:id: Retrieve a specific task by ID.
POST /api/tasks: Create a new task.
PUT /api/tasks/:id: Update an existing task.
DELETE /api/tasks/:id: Delete a task.
Ensure that the API adheres to RESTful principles, using appropriate HTTP methods and status codes.
Token-Based Authentication:

Implement token-based authentication for API access.
Suggest using the Devise Token Auth gem or a similar authentication solution.
Require students to generate tokens for users and secure API endpoints to only allow authenticated access.
API Documentation:

Guide students in creating comprehensive API documentation using tools like Swagger, Postman, or built-in Rails documentation.
Include details on available endpoints, request/response formats, authentication requirements, and example API requests.
Testing:

Encourage students to test the API endpoints using API testing tools (e.g., Postman, Curl) to ensure they function correctly.
Submission:

Instruct students to submit the following for evaluation:
A link to the API documentation.
Demonstration of successful API testing with examples.
Evaluation Criteria:

Successful implementation of RESTful API endpoints for task management.
Proper token-based authentication to secure API endpoints.
Well-documented API with clear instructions for usage.
Effective testing of API endpoints to ensure functionality.
Adherence to RESTful principles and conventions.
