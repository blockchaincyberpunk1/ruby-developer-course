Introduction to Testing with RSpec

Objective: To introduce students to testing frameworks in Ruby, specifically RSpec.

Task:

In this assignment, students will explore testing in Ruby by getting hands-on experience with RSpec, a popular testing framework. They will learn how to write and run unit tests for critical components of a Ruby on Rails application, ensuring code quality and reliability.

Instructions:

Set Up a Ruby on Rails Project:

Students should either create a new Ruby on Rails application or use their existing project.
Ensure they have a basic understanding of the application's structure, including models and controllers.
Install and Configure RSpec:

Guide students through the process of installing RSpec as a testing framework for their project.
Explain how to configure RSpec in the project's settings.
Writing Unit Tests:

Instruct students to identify critical components in their application, such as models and controllers, that need testing.
Teach them the syntax for writing RSpec tests, including writing context blocks and test cases (describe, context, it).
Task students with writing unit tests for these components, covering various scenarios, edge cases, and validations.
Running Tests Locally:

Ensure students understand how to run RSpec tests locally using commands like bundle exec rspec.
Continuous Integration (CI) Setup:

Introduce students to the concept of CI and its benefits in automated testing.
Instruct them to set up a CI pipeline using a CI service of their choice, such as Travis CI or GitHub Actions.
Configure the CI pipeline to run RSpec tests automatically whenever code changes are pushed to the repository.
Monitoring CI Results:

Encourage students to monitor their CI pipeline's results, including test successes and failures.
Teach them how to interpret CI reports and troubleshoot test failures.
Documentation:

Require students to document their testing process, including the purpose of each test, any special considerations, and how to run the tests locally.
Emphasize the importance of clear documentation for future developers.
Evaluation Criteria:

Successful installation and configuration of RSpec in the Rails project.
Comprehensive unit tests written for critical components, covering different scenarios.
CI pipeline set up and configured to run RSpec tests automatically.
Effective monitoring and troubleshooting of test results.
Clear and well-structured documentation of the testing process.
