Assignment: Exploring Basic Ruby Concepts

Assignment Overview:
In this assignment, you will be guided through writing a simple Ruby script that demonstrates fundamental concepts such as variable declaration, output, and basic arithmetic operations. This assignment is designed to help you practice the basics of Ruby programming.

Instructions:

Step 1: Setting Up Your Environment
Ensure you have Ruby installed on your computer. You can download it from the official Ruby website (https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/documentation/installation/).

Step 2: Writing the Ruby Script

Task: Create a Ruby script that performs basic arithmetic operations and displays the results.

Script Requirements:

Declare variables to store two integer values.
Perform addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division operations using the variables.
Output the results of each operation with appropriate messages.
Sample Output:

yaml
Copy code
Number 1: 10
Number 2: 5
Addition: 10 + 5 = 15
Subtraction: 10 - 5 = 5
Multiplication: 10 * 5 = 50
Division: 10 / 5 = 2
Step 3: Writing the Script

Open a text editor or integrated development environment (IDE) to write your Ruby script.
Write the necessary code to fulfill the script requirements.

Here's the Ruby code for the script:

ruby
Copy code
# Ruby script to demonstrate basic arithmetic operations

# Declare variables
number1 = 10
number2 = 5

# Perform arithmetic operations
addition = number1 + number2
subtraction = number1 - number2
multiplication = number1 * number2
division = number1 / number2

# Output the results
puts "Number 1: #{number1}"
puts "Number 2: #{number2}"
puts "Addition: #{number1} + #{number2} = #{addition}"
puts "Subtraction: #{number1} - #{number2} = #{subtraction}"
puts "Multiplication: #{number1} * #{number2} = #{multiplication}"
puts "Division: #{number1} / #{number2} = #{division}"
Step 4: Testing the Script

Save the script with a meaningful file name, such as basic_arithmetic.rb.
Open your terminal or command prompt.
Navigate to the directory where you saved your Ruby script.
Run the script by typing ruby basic_arithmetic.rb.
Step 5: Documentation and Reflection

Document your script with comments to explain the purpose of each section of code.
Reflect on the experience of writing the script and any challenges you encountered.

ruby
Copy code
# This Ruby script demonstrates basic arithmetic operations using variables.

# Declare variables
number1 = 10
number2 = 5

# Perform arithmetic operations
addition = number1 + number2
subtraction = number1 - number2
multiplication = number1 * number2
division = number1 / number2

# Output the results
puts "Number 1: #{number1}"
puts "Number 2: #{number2}"
puts "Addition: #{number1} + #{number2} = #{addition}"
puts "Subtraction: #{number1} - #{number2} = #{subtraction}"
puts "Multiplication: #{number1} * #{number2} = #{multiplication}"
puts "Division: #{number1} / #{number2} = #{division}"
Additional Instructions:

User-Friendly Output: Ensure your script generates clear and informative output messages.
Code Organization: Organize your code with proper indentation and comments for clarity.
Submission:

Compile your Ruby script file and your documentation into a single folder. Include a readme file that explains the purpose of the assignment.

Assessment:

Your assignment will be assessed based on the correctness of your script, the adherence to the requirements, and the clarity of your code and documentation.

Submission:

Compile your assignment files (Ruby script file, documentation, readme) into a single folder. Submit the folder through the designated platform by [submission deadline].

This assignment will provide you with a hands-on experience of working with basic concepts in Ruby programming. Enjoy the process of coding and testing your script!
