Assignment: Exploring Arrays and Hashes in Ruby

Assignment Overview:
In this assignment, you will dive into the world of arrays and hashes in Ruby. You will engage in hands-on exercises that involve creating arrays and hashes, performing various operations on them, and practicing element manipulation.

Instructions:

Part 1: Exploring Arrays

Step 1: Create an empty array named fruits.

ruby
Copy code
fruits = []
Step 2: Add the following fruits to the array: "apple", "banana", "orange", "grape", "watermelon".

ruby
Copy code
fruits.push("apple", "banana", "orange", "grape", "watermelon")
Step 3: Display the contents of the array using the puts method.

ruby
Copy code
puts fruits.inspect
Step 4: Replace "banana" with "kiwi" and update the array.

ruby
Copy code
fruits[1] = "kiwi"
Step 5: Remove "orange" from the array.

ruby
Copy code
fruits.delete("orange")
Step 6: Find and display the length of the array using the length method.

ruby
Copy code
length = fruits.length
puts "The length of the array is: #{length}"
Step 7: Access and display the first and last elements of the array.

ruby
Copy code
first_fruit = fruits.first
last_fruit = fruits.last
puts "First fruit: #{first_fruit}, Last fruit: #{last_fruit}"
Step 8: Sort the array in alphabetical order and display the sorted result.

ruby
Copy code
sorted_fruits = fruits.sort
puts "Sorted fruits: #{sorted_fruits.inspect}"
Part 2: Exploring Hashes

Step 1: Create an empty hash named person.

ruby
Copy code
person = {}
Step 2: Add the following key-value pairs to the hash:

ruby
Copy code
person["name"] = "Alice"
person["age"] = 25
person["occupation"] = "Software Engineer"
Step 3: Display the contents of the hash using the puts method.

ruby
Copy code
puts person.inspect
Step 4: Update the value associated with the "age" key to 26.

ruby
Copy code
person["age"] = 26
Step 5: Remove the "occupation" key-value pair from the hash.

ruby
Copy code
person.delete("occupation")
Step 6: Check if the hash contains the key "address" and display the result.

ruby
Copy code
contains_address = person.key?("address")
puts "Contains address key? #{contains_address}"
Step 7: Access and display the value associated with the "name" key.

ruby
Copy code
name_value = person["name"]
puts "Name: #{name_value}"
Step 8: Display all keys and values in the hash using appropriate methods.

ruby
Copy code
keys = person.keys
values = person.values
puts "Keys: #{keys.inspect}"
puts "Values: #{values.inspect}"
Additional Instructions:

Documentation: Include comments that explain the purpose and functionality of each part of your code.
Code Clarity: Maintain a well-organized code structure with proper indentation.
Submission:

Compile your Ruby script file and your documentation into a single folder. Include a readme file that explains the purpose of the assignment.

Assessment:

Your assignment will be assessed based on your ability to create, manipulate, and interact with arrays and hashes, as well as the clarity of your documentation.

Submission:

Compile your assignment files (Ruby script file, documentation, readme) into a single folder. Submit the folder through the designated platform by [submission deadline].

This assignment provides practical exercises to build confidence in working with arrays and hashes, essential data structures in Ruby programming. Enjoy the process of learning and exploring these concepts!
