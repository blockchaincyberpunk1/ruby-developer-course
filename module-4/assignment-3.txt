Assignment: Exploring Arrays and Hashes Operations in Ruby

Assignment Overview:
In this assignment, you will have the opportunity to practice creating arrays and hashes in Ruby and perform specific operations on them. By completing the tasks, you will gain a deeper understanding of working with these fundamental data structures and their various operations.

Instructions:

Part 1: Arrays Exploration

Step 1: Create an array named numbers containing the following integers: 5, 10, 15, 20, 25.

ruby
Copy code
numbers = [5, 10, 15, 20, 25]
Step 2: Use array methods to:
a. Add the number 30 to the end of the array.

ruby
Copy code
numbers.push(30)
b. Remove the number 10 from the array.

ruby
Copy code
numbers.delete(10)
c. Insert the number 12 at index 2.

ruby
Copy code
numbers.insert(2, 12)
d. Find the total number of elements in the array.

ruby
Copy code
total_elements = numbers.length
e. Check if the array contains the number 15.

ruby
Copy code
contains_15 = numbers.include?(15)
f. Access and display the element at index 3.

ruby
Copy code
element_at_index_3 = numbers[3]
Part 2: Hashes Exploration

Step 1: Create a hash named book representing a book's information with the following key-value pairs:

ruby
Copy code
book = {
  "title" => "The Great Gatsby",
  "author" => "F. Scott Fitzgerald",
  "year" => 1925
}
Step 2: Use hash methods to:
a. Add a new key "genre" with the value "Fiction" to the hash.

ruby
Copy code
book["genre"] = "Fiction"
b. Update the author's name to "Francis Scott Fitzgerald."

ruby
Copy code
book["author"] = "Francis Scott Fitzgerald"
c. Remove the "year" key from the hash.

ruby
Copy code
book.delete("year")
d. Check if the hash contains the key "rating."

ruby
Copy code
contains_rating = book.key?("rating")
e. Access and display the value associated with the "title" key.

ruby
Copy code
title_value = book["title"]
Part 3: Reporting

Write a brief report summarizing your findings from both the array and hash explorations.
In this assignment, I performed the following tasks:

Array Exploration:

Created an array named numbers with integers 5, 10, 15, 20, 25.
Used array methods to add 30 to the end, remove 10, and insert 12 at index 2.
Found the total number of elements in the array and checked if it contains 15.
Accessed and displayed the element at index 3.
Hash Exploration:

Created a hash named book representing book information.
Used hash methods to add a "genre" key, update the author's name, and remove the "year" key.
Checked if the hash contains the key "rating" and accessed the value associated with the "title" key.
My observations and insights:

Arrays and hashes are versatile data structures in Ruby.
Array methods like push, delete, and include? are helpful for manipulation.
Hash methods like []=, delete, and key? provide efficient ways to modify and access data.
Additional Instructions:

Documentation: Include comments that explain the purpose and functionality of each part of your code.
Code Clarity: Maintain a well-organized code structure with proper indentation.
Submission:

Compile your Ruby script file, your report, and any other necessary files into a single folder.

Assessment:

Your assignment will be assessed based on your ability to create, manipulate, and interact with arrays and hashes, as well as the clarity of your documentation and report.

Submission:

Compile your assignment files (Ruby script file, report) into a single folder. Submit the folder through the designated platform by [submission deadline].

This assignment encourages you to explore and document your experience with arrays and hashes, two core data structures in Ruby programming. Enjoy the process of experimentation and learning!
