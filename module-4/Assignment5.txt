Advanced Enumerables (Optional)

Objective: To challenge students with more complex enumerable tasks and introduce advanced enumerable methods in Ruby.

Task:
In this optional assignment, students will explore advanced enumerable methods in Ruby and apply them to solve complex data processing or manipulation tasks. Students are encouraged to design a program that leverages advanced enumerable methods like group_by, inject, zip, or others for a specific task. This assignment aims to demonstrate the efficiency and power of advanced enumerable techniques.

Instructions:

Method Selection:

Instruct students to choose one or more advanced enumerable methods to work with. Examples include:
group_by: Group data based on a specific criterion or attribute.
inject (also known as reduce): Perform calculations that involve accumulating results across elements.
zip: Combine multiple collections into a single collection of tuples.
flat_map: Transform and flatten nested arrays or collections.
Other advanced enumerable methods available in Ruby.
Problem Statement:

Define a specific problem or task that requires the use of advanced enumerable methods. Examples include:
Analyzing data to find patterns or trends.
Calculating complex statistics.
Combining and restructuring data from multiple sources.
Processing nested or multi-dimensional data structures.
Implementation:

Students should design and implement a Ruby program that:
Reads data, either from an external source or through manually defined collections.
Applies the chosen advanced enumerable methods to solve the problem.
Demonstrates the effectiveness and efficiency of the selected methods.
Output and Presentation:

Encourage students to display the results of their data processing in a clear and organized manner.
The output can include statistics, grouped data, transformed data, or any relevant information.
Students should also provide commentary or documentation explaining their approach and how advanced enumerable methods were used.
Testing and Verification:

Students should test their program with various datasets to ensure it works correctly and efficiently for different scenarios.
Commentary and Documentation:

Students should include comments and documentation in their code to explain the problem, the advanced enumerable methods used, and how these methods contribute to solving the problem.
Evaluation Criteria:

Effective selection and use of advanced enumerable methods to solve a complex problem.
Clear and organized code that demonstrates the use of advanced enumerables.
Output that effectively communicates the results of data processing.
Thorough testing and verification to ensure the program's correctness.
Well-documented code with comments explaining the problem and approach.
