Building a Blogging Platform (Optional)

Objective: To challenge students with a more complex project that applies advanced Ruby concepts.

Task:
In this optional assignment, students will have the opportunity to design and build a simple blogging platform using Ruby classes. The goal is to apply the knowledge gained throughout the course and tackle a more complex project. The assignment encourages students to create classes for User, BlogPost, and Comment, establishing relationships between them, and implementing various features of a blogging platform. Additionally, they should utilize inheritance and modules to enhance code structure and reusability.

Here are the details of the assignment:

Define Classes:

Instruct students to define the following classes:
User: Represents a user of the blogging platform. Users should have attributes like username, email, and password. Implement methods for user registration, login, and profile management.
BlogPost: Represents a blog post with attributes like title, content, publication date, and author (a User object). Implement methods for creating, editing, and deleting blog posts.
Comment: Represents a comment on a blog post with attributes like content, publication date, and author (a User object). Implement methods for adding and managing comments on blog posts.
Relationships and Data Structures:

Establish relationships between the User, BlogPost, and Comment classes. For example, a User can have many BlogPosts, and a BlogPost can have many Comments.
Implement data structures to manage these relationships, such as arrays or hashes.
Features and Functionality:

Encourage students to create a menu system or user interface (command-line or web-based) that allows users to perform actions like user registration, login, creating blog posts, adding comments, and viewing posts.
Implement user authentication and authorization to ensure that only authorized users can edit or delete their posts and comments.
Apply concepts of data validation and error handling.
Code Organization:

Challenge students to use inheritance or modules to promote code reuse and maintainability. For example, they can create a Module for authentication methods that can be included in both the User and BlogPost classes.
Testing (Optional):

If students are comfortable with testing frameworks, encourage them to write tests for their classes and methods using tools like RSpec or MiniTest.
Documentation:

Emphasize the importance of clear code documentation and comments to explain the purpose and functionality of their classes and methods.
Evaluation Criteria:

Correct definition and implementation of the User, BlogPost, and Comment classes.
Proper establishment of relationships between classes and data structures.
Successful implementation of user registration, login, and blogging features.
Effective use of inheritance or modules to enhance code structure and reusability.
Implementation of user authentication and authorization mechanisms.
Appropriate use of data validation and error handling.
Optional testing (if implemented) and documentation for clarity and understanding.
User-friendly interface or menu system for interacting with the blogging platform.
