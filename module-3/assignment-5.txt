Assignment: Exploring Mixins Through Reusable Modules in Ruby

Assignment Overview:
In this assignment, you will dive deeper into the concept of mixins in Ruby by creating a practical module containing useful methods. You will then incorporate this module into different classes to demonstrate the power of mixins and observe how they enhance the functionality of the classes.

Instructions:

Step 1: Module Creation
Create a module named UtilityMethods.
Define a set of practical and reusable methods within the module. These methods could be related to calculations, formatting, or any other utility functions.

Here's an example of the UtilityMethods module with some utility methods:

ruby
Copy code
module UtilityMethods
  def calculate_average(numbers)
    total = numbers.reduce(0, :+)
    total / numbers.length.to_f
  end

  def format_as_currency(amount)
    "$#{'%.2f' % amount}"
  end
end
Step 2: Class Incorporation
Create at least three different classes that represent various scenarios (e.g., Calculator, TextAnalyzer, DataProcessor).
Incorporate the UtilityMethods module into all of these classes using mixins.

Incorporating the UtilityMethods module into the Calculator class:

ruby
Copy code
class Calculator
  include UtilityMethods

  def initialize(numbers)
    @numbers = numbers
  end

  def display_average
    avg = calculate_average(@numbers)
    puts "Average: #{format_as_currency(avg)}"
  end
end
Incorporating the UtilityMethods module into the TextAnalyzer class:

ruby
Copy code
class TextAnalyzer
  include UtilityMethods

  def initialize(text)
    @text = text
  end

  def analyze_text
    words = @text.split
    avg_word_length = calculate_average(words.map(&:length))
    puts "Average word length: #{avg_word_length}"
  end
end
Step 3: Method Usage and Exploration
Inside each class, utilize the methods provided by the UtilityMethods module.
Experiment with different combinations of classes and methods to observe how mixins enhance the functionality of the classes.
Document your observations and insights regarding the behavior of the classes after incorporating the module.

Step 4: Documentation and Reflection
Document the creation of the UtilityMethods module and its methods.
Explain how the module was incorporated into different classes and how mixins contribute to code modularity.
Reflect on the benefits of using mixins for sharing functionality among classes.

Additional Instructions:

Method Relevance: Ensure that the methods within the UtilityMethods module are relevant and can be applied to various scenarios.
Mixin Implementation: Show how to incorporate the module into the classes using the appropriate Ruby syntax.
Code Exploration: Experiment with different class-method combinations to observe the effects of mixins.
Code Clarity: Maintain clear and concise code structure with proper indentation and comments.
Submission:

Compile your Ruby script file and your documentation into a single folder. Include a readme file that explains the purpose of the assignment.

Assessment:

Your assignment will be assessed based on the implementation of mixins, the appropriateness of the module's methods, and the clarity of your documentation.

Submission:

Compile your assignment files (Ruby script file, documentation, readme) into a single folder. Submit the folder through the designated platform by [submission deadline].

This assignment provides an opportunity for you to explore practical applications of mixins through reusable modules. Enjoy the process of creating modular and versatile code!
