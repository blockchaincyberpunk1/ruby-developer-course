Assignment: Implementing Mixins in Ruby Classes for Method Reuse

Assignment Overview:
In this assignment, you will gain hands-on experience with mixins in Ruby by implementing them in a set of classes. You will create a module containing reusable methods and incorporate it into different classes to demonstrate the concept of method reuse through mixins.

Instructions:

Step 1: Module Creation
Create a module named ReusableMethods.
Define a variety of methods within the module that can be reused across different classes. Consider methods that are applicable to different scenarios.

Here's an example of the ReusableMethods module with some reusable methods:

ruby
Copy code
module ReusableMethods
  def generate_id
    "#{self.class.name}-#{SecureRandom.hex(4)}"
  end

  def log_action(action)
    puts "#{self.class.name} performed action: #{action}"
  end
end
Step 2: Class Implementation
Choose at least three distinct classes representing different entities or concepts (e.g., Vehicle, Employee, Product).
Incorporate the ReusableMethods module into each class using mixins.

Incorporating the ReusableMethods module into the Vehicle class:

ruby
Copy code
class Vehicle
  include ReusableMethods

  def initialize(make, model)
    @make = make
    @model = model
    @id = generate_id
  end

  def start_engine
    log_action("Engine started")
    # Start the engine logic
  end
end
Incorporating the ReusableMethods module into the Employee class:

ruby
Copy code
class Employee
  include ReusableMethods

  def initialize(name, role)
    @name = name
    @role = role
    @id = generate_id
  end

  def perform_task(task)
    log_action("Performed task: #{task}")
    # Task execution logic
  end
end
Step 3: Method Reuse
Inside each class, utilize the methods provided by the ReusableMethods module.
Implement additional class-specific methods that enhance the functionality of the classes.

Step 4: Code Demonstration
Create instances of the classes and demonstrate the use of both class-specific and reusable methods.
Showcase how the methods from the ReusableMethods module can be called on different classes.

Step 5: Documentation and Reflection
Document the creation of the ReusableMethods module and its methods.
Explain how the module was incorporated into different classes and the advantages of using mixins for method reuse.
Reflect on the benefits of reusing methods and how mixins contribute to code organization.

Additional Instructions:

Method Variability: Ensure that the methods within the ReusableMethods module are generic enough to be reused across various classes.
Mixin Implementation: Illustrate how to incorporate the module into the classes using appropriate Ruby syntax.
Code Clarity: Maintain organized and well-commented code.
Submission:

Compile your Ruby script file and your documentation into a single folder. Include a readme file that explains the purpose of the assignment.

Assessment:

Your assignment will be assessed based on the successful implementation of mixins, the appropriateness of the module's methods, and the clarity of your documentation.

Submission:

Compile your assignment files (Ruby script file, documentation, readme) into a single folder. Submit the folder through the designated platform by [submission deadline].

This assignment provides a practical opportunity to implement mixins and experience the benefits of method reuse across different classes. Enjoy exploring the concept of code modularity and reusability!
