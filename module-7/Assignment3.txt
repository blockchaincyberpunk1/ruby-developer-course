Adding Advanced Features (Part 1) - Notifications

Objective: To challenge students to implement advanced features in a Rails application.

Task:

In this assignment, students will enhance their Task Management App created in previous assignments by adding a notifications feature. The goal is to provide users with reminders for upcoming due dates on their tasks.

Instructions:

Project Setup:

Instruct students to continue working on their existing Task Management App project.
Notifications Feature:

Explain the concept of notifications and the benefits of providing reminders to users.
Task Due Dates:

Introduce the concept of due dates for tasks.
Modify the "Task" model to include a due date attribute.
Notification Preferences:

Implement a feature that allows users to customize their notification preferences. For example, they can choose to receive notifications via email or in-app notifications.
Notification Logic:

Develop the logic for triggering notifications based on task due dates.
Decide when and how notifications should be sent (e.g., daily email reminders for tasks due within the next 24 hours).
Implementation Options:

Students can implement notifications using various approaches:
Email notifications: Utilize a gem like "Action Mailer" to send email reminders.
In-app notifications: Implement in-app notifications using libraries or custom code.
User Interface:

Modify the user interface to display due dates and notification settings.
Allow users to set due dates when creating or editing tasks.
Testing:

Encourage students to thoroughly test the notifications feature to ensure it works as expected.
Test different scenarios, such as tasks with due dates in the past, notifications preferences, and notification delivery.
Documentation:

Update the README.md file to include instructions for using the notifications feature.
Include information on setting due dates and customizing notification preferences.
Evaluation Criteria:

Successful implementation of task due dates in the Task model.
Implementation of notification preferences with user customization.
Proper logic for triggering notifications based on due dates.
Implementation of notifications through email or in-app notifications (students can choose one or both methods).
Modification of the user interface to support due dates and notification settings.
Thorough testing of the notifications feature with different scenarios.
Updated documentation that provides clear instructions for using the notifications feature.
