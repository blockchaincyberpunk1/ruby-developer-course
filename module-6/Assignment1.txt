Set Up a Basic Rails Application

Objective: To familiarize students with setting up a basic Ruby on Rails application.

Task:

In this assignment, students will create a new Ruby on Rails application from scratch and implement basic CRUD functionality for a simple resource. They will gain hands-on experience in setting up the Rails environment and building a basic web application.

Instructions:

Environment Setup:

Instruct students to set up their development environment with Ruby and Rails installed. They can use tools like RVM or rbenv to manage their Ruby versions.
Ensure that students have a working knowledge of using the terminal or command prompt for running Rails commands.
Create a New Rails Application:

Have students create a new Ruby on Rails application using the rails new command. They should give their application a meaningful name.
Generate a Resource:

Ask students to generate a new resource using the Rails generator. For example, they can create a "Task" resource for a to-do list application.

rails generate scaffold Task title:string description:text


This command generates a model, view, and controller for the "Task" resource with attributes for the title and description.
Implement CRUD Functionality:

Guide students through the process of implementing basic CRUD functionality for the generated resource. They should be able to:
Create new tasks.
Read and display a list of tasks.
Update existing tasks.
Delete tasks.
Test the Application:

Instruct students to run their Rails application locally using the rails server command and test the CRUD operations through a web browser or API client like Postman.
Documentation:

Require students to provide documentation or comments within their code to explain the purpose and functionality of different parts of their application.
Example (Basic To-Do List Application):


# Terminal Commands
rails new ToDoListApp
cd ToDoListApp
rails generate scaffold Task title:string description:text
rails db:migrate

# Edit the generated controller (tasks_controller.rb) to add strong parameters.

# Implement CRUD functionality in the views and controller.

# Run the application locally:
rails server


Evaluation Criteria:

Successful creation of a new Ruby on Rails application.
Proper generation of a resource with attributes.
Implementation of CRUD functionality for the resource.
Error-free execution of the application locally for testing.
Clear and organized code with comments explaining functionality.
Adherence to Rails conventions and best practices.
