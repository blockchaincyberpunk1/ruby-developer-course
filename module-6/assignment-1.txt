Assignment: Creating a New Ruby on Rails Application

Assignment Overview:
In this assignment, you will guide students through the process of creating a new Ruby on Rails application from scratch. This exercise will help students understand the initial setup, installation, and generation of a basic application structure using the Ruby on Rails framework.

Instructions:

Step 1: Install Ruby and Rails

Provide students with instructions to install Ruby and Rails on their local machines if they haven't already.
Explain how to use the command-line interface to check the installed versions of Ruby and Rails.

bash
Copy code
# Check Ruby version
ruby -v

# Check Rails version
rails -v
Step 2: Create a New Rails Application

Walk students through the process of creating a new Rails application using the rails new command.
Explain the various options that can be passed to the command, such as specifying the database type or skipping unnecessary files.

bash
Copy code
# Create a new Rails application named 'myapp'
rails new myapp

# Options:
# -d specifies the database type (e.g., -d postgresql)
# --skip-bundle skips running bundle install
# --skip-test skips generating test files
Step 3: Navigate the Application Structure

Guide students through navigating the application's directory structure, highlighting key directories and files.
Explain the purpose of each directory, such as app, config, db, and public.

text
Copy code
myapp/
  ├── app/           # Application code
  ├── config/        # Configuration files
  ├── db/            # Database-related files and migrations
  ├── public/        # Public assets (images, stylesheets, JavaScript)
  └── ...
Step 4: Run the Development Server

Show students how to use the rails server command to start the development server.
Instruct them to open a web browser and access the application at http://localhost:3000.

bash
Copy code
# Start the development server
rails server

# Access the application in a web browser: http://localhost:3000
Step 5: Explore the Default Page

Explain how Rails automatically generates a welcome page for new applications.
Instruct students to explore the default welcome page and its associated controller and view.

Step 6: Generate a Scaffold

Demonstrate how to generate a scaffold, which creates a full set of CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) actions for a resource.
Guide students through generating a scaffold for a simple model, such as Post.

bash
Copy code
# Generate a scaffold for 'Post' model
rails generate scaffold Post title:string content:text
Step 7: Migrate the Database

Explain how to use database migrations to create or modify database tables.
Instruct students to run rails db:migrate to apply the migrations and create the necessary database tables.

bash
Copy code
# Run database migrations
rails db:migrate
Step 8: Test the Scaffold

Show students how to navigate to the scaffold's index page, create new records, and view individual records.
Instruct them to experiment with editing and deleting records as well.

Additional Instructions:

Documentation: Encourage students to take notes during each step of the process.
Troubleshooting: Provide guidance on common issues students might encounter and how to resolve them.
Submission:

Students should submit their documentation, including notes on each step, observations, and any issues encountered, through the designated platform by [submission deadline].

This assignment will provide students with hands-on experience in creating a new Ruby on Rails application and exploring its basic structure. It's a fundamental skill for web development using the Rails framework.
