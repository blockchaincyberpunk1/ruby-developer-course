Assignment: Creating a New Ruby on Rails Application - Step by Step

Assignment Overview:
In this assignment, you will guide students through the step-by-step process of creating a new Ruby on Rails application. The goal is to provide a detailed walkthrough from installing Rails to creating a simple model, view, and controller to demonstrate the Model-View-Controller (MVC) separation in a Rails project.

Instructions:

Step 1: Install Rails

Explain to students how to open the command-line interface on their machines.
Walk them through the process of installing Rails using the command: gem install rails.
Instruct them to verify the installation using: rails --version.
Step 2: Generate a New Rails Application

Guide students through the process of creating a new Rails application using the command: rails new MyApp (replace "MyApp" with the desired application name).
Discuss various options that can be passed during the creation process, such as choosing a database or skipping specific components.
Step 3: Navigate the Application Structure

Explain the purpose of each main directory in a Rails application, such as app, config, db, public, and more.
Emphasize the separation of concerns between different parts of the application.
Step 4: Create a Simple Model

Demonstrate how to generate a new model using the rails generate model command.
Walk students through the creation of a simple model, such as a "Post," including specifying attributes.
Step 5: Migrate the Database

Explain the concept of database migrations and how they're used to manage the database schema.
Guide students through running the command: rails db:migrate to apply the model's migration and create the corresponding database table.
Step 6: Generate a Controller and View

Discuss the role of controllers in handling user requests and generating responses.
Show students how to generate a controller using the rails generate controller command.
Instruct them to create an action within the controller and generate a corresponding view.
Step 7: Route the Controller Action

Explain the concept of routing and how it maps incoming requests to controller actions.
Guide students through adding a route in the config/routes.rb file to link the controller action to a specific URL.
Step 8: Add Content to the View

Walk students through opening the generated view file and adding HTML content.
Instruct them to use Ruby tags to display dynamic content from the model.
Step 9: Test the Application

Show students how to start the development server using the rails server command.
Instruct them to open a web browser and access the route corresponding to the controller action they defined.
Additional Instructions:

Documentation: Encourage students to take notes during each step to create a comprehensive guide.
Troubleshooting: Provide guidance on potential errors or issues they might encounter.
Submission:

Students should submit their completed step-by-step guide, which includes explanations and notes for each step, through the designated platform by [submission deadline].

This assignment will equip students with a thorough understanding of the process of creating a new Ruby on Rails application and the core components of the Rails framework.
