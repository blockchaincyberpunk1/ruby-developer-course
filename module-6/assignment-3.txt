Assignment: Exploring MVC Architecture in a Real-World Rails Application

Assignment Overview:
In this assignment, you will task students with researching and preparing a brief report on the Model-View-Controller (MVC) architecture in a real-world Ruby on Rails application. The objective is to help them understand how MVC components are implemented and interact within a Rails application.

Instructions:

Step 1: Research a Real-World Rails Application

Instruct students to choose a real-world Ruby on Rails application to research. They can explore open-source projects, popular websites, or any application of their interest.
Emphasize the importance of selecting an application with publicly available code or documentation.
Step 2: Identify Models, Views, and Controllers

Guide students to analyze the chosen Rails application and identify the key models, views, and controllers.
Encourage them to list and describe the main components, their responsibilities, and their relationships within the MVC architecture.
Step 3: Explain Interactions

Ask students to explain how models, views, and controllers interact with each other in the application.
Instruct them to describe how data flows between these components and how they collaborate to handle user requests and generate responses.
Step 4: Prepare a Brief Report

Guide students to compile their findings and insights into a brief report.
Instruct them to include an introduction to the chosen application, descriptions of models, views, and controllers, and explanations of their interactions.
Encourage students to provide examples or scenarios that illustrate the interactions within the MVC architecture.
Additional Instructions:

Research: Emphasize the importance of thorough research and understanding the selected application's structure.
Documentation: Encourage students to provide clear and concise explanations in their report.
Real-World Insight: Highlight the significance of gaining insights into how MVC architecture is applied in actual projects.
Assessment:
Students' reports will be assessed based on the accuracy of their identification of MVC components, clarity in explaining interactions, and the quality of their overall report.

Submission:
Students should submit their completed reports through the designated platform by [submission deadline].

By completing this assignment, students will gain a practical understanding of how the Model-View-Controller (MVC) architecture is implemented and operates in real-world Ruby on Rails applications.
