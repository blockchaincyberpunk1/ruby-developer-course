Assignment: Building a Simple CRUD Application with Rails

Assignment Overview:
In this assignment, you will guide students through the process of creating a basic CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) application using Ruby on Rails. The objective is to help them practice implementing models, views, and controllers to manage a simple data entity.

Instructions:

Step 1: Set Up a New Rails Application

Instruct students to create a new Ruby on Rails application using the command line.
Guide them through the process of generating the necessary files and directory structure.
Step 2: Define the Data Entity

Ask students to define a simple data entity for their CRUD application. This could be something like "Tasks," "Notes," or any other entity they choose.
Instruct them to generate a model for the chosen data entity, specifying the attributes it will have.
Step 3: Create Controllers and Views

Guide students to generate a controller for the data entity.
Instruct them to create the necessary views for actions such as listing all items, showing a single item, creating a new item, updating an item, and deleting an item.
Step 4: Implement CRUD Operations

Walk students through implementing the CRUD operations for their chosen data entity:
Create: Allow users to add new items to the application.
Read: Display a list of all items and allow users to view individual items.
Update: Enable users to edit and update existing items.
Delete: Provide the ability to delete items from the application.
Step 5: Test and Validate

Instruct students to test the application by running it locally and interacting with the CRUD functionality.
Encourage them to ensure that each CRUD operation works as expected and that data is being manipulated correctly.
Additional Instructions:

Hands-On Practice: Emphasize the importance of hands-on practice to understand the process of building a CRUD application.
Documentation: Encourage students to document their process, including any challenges they faced and how they resolved them.
Assessment:
Students' applications will be assessed based on the successful implementation of CRUD functionality, adherence to the provided instructions, and the quality of their documentation.

Submission:
Students should submit their completed CRUD application code and any relevant documentation through the designated platform by [submission deadline].

By completing this assignment, students will gain practical experience in building a basic CRUD application using Ruby on Rails, reinforcing their understanding of models, views, and controllers.
